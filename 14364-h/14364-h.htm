    <h2>DOING THE OLD MASTERS.</h2>

    <h3>(<i>A Sketch at Burlington House</i>.)</h3>

    <h4>IN GALLERY NO. I.</h4>

    <p><i>The Usual Elderly Lady</i> (<i>who judges every picture
    solely by its subject</i>). "No. 9. Portrait of Mrs. BRYANSTON
    of Portman. By GAINSBOROUGH." I don't like that at all. Such a
    <i>disagreeable</i> expression! I can't think why they exhibit
    such things. I'm sure there's no <i>pleasure</i> in looking at
    them!</p>

    <p><i>Her Companion</i> (<i>who finds no pleasure in looking at
    any of them</i>). No, I must say I prefer the Academy to these
    old-fashioned things. I suppose we can get a cup of <i>tea</i>
    here, though?</p>

    <p><i>An Intelligent Person</i>. "Mrs. BRYANSTON of Portman."
    Sounds like a made-up name rather, eh? Portman Square, and all
    that, y'know!</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:35%;">
        <a href="images/121.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/121.png"
             alt="'My dear fellow, as if it was possible to mistake his touch!'" />
        </a>"My dear fellow, as if it was possible to mistake his
        touch!"
    </div>

    <p><i>His Friend</i> (<i>with a touching confidence in the
    seriousness of the authorities</i>). Oh, they wouldn't do that
    sort of thing <i>here</i>!</p>

    <p><i>A Too-impulsive Enthusiast</i>. Oh, JOHN, <i>look</i> at
    that lovely tiger up there! <i>Isn't</i> the skin marvellously
    painted, and the eyes so natural and all! It's a Landseer of
    <i>course</i>!</p>

    <p><i>John</i>. Catalogue says STUBBS.</p>

    <p><i>The Enth.</i> (<i>disenchanted</i>). STUBBS? I never
    heard of him. But it's really rather well done.</p>

    <p><i>The Man who is a bit of a Connoisseur in his way</i>
    (<i>arriving at a portrait of</i> Mrs. BILLINGTON). Not a bad
    Romney, that.</p>

    <p><i>His Friend</i> (<i>with Catalogue</i>). What makes you
    think it's a Romney?</p>

    <p><i>The Conn.</i> My dear fellow, as if it was possible to
    mistake his touch. (<i>Thinks from his friend's expression,
    that he had better hedge.</i>) Unless it's a Reynolds. Of
    course it <i>might</i> be a Sir Joshua, their manner at one
    period was very much alike&mdash;yes, it might be a Reynolds,
    certainly.</p>

    <p><i>His Friend</i>. It might be a Holbein&mdash;if it didn't
    happen to be a Gainsborough.</p>

    <p><i>The Conn.</i> (<i>effecting a masterly retreat</i>).
    Didn't I <i>say</i> Gainsborough? Of course that was what I
    <i>meant</i>. Nothing like Reynolds&mdash;nor Romney either.
    Totally different thing!</p>

    <h4>IN GALLERY NO. II.</h4>

    <p><i>Mr. Ernest Stodgely</i> (<i>before</i> JAN STEEN's
    "<i>Christening</i>"). Now look at this, FLOSSIE; very curious,
    very interesting. Gives you such an insight into the times.
    This man, you see, is wearing a hat of the period. Remarkable,
    isn't it?</p>

    <p><i>Miss Featherhead</i>. Not so remarkable as if he was
    wearing a hat of some <i>other</i> period, ERNEST, is it?</p>

    <p><i>The Elderly Lady</i> (<i>before a View of Amsterdam, by
    Van der Heyden</i>). Now, you really <i>must</i> look at this,
    my dear&mdash;isn't it wonderful? Why, you can count every
    single brick in the walls, and the tiny little figures with
    their features all complete; you want a magnifying-glass to
    <i>see</i> it all! How conscientious painters were in those
    days! And <i>what</i> a difference from those "Impressionists,"
    as they call themselves.</p>

    <p><i>Her Comp.</i> (<i>apathetically</i>). Yes, indeed; I
    wonder whether it would be better to get our tea here, or wait
    till we get outside?</p>

    <p><i>The Eld. L.</i> Oh, it's too early yet. Look at that poor
    hunted stag jumping over a dining-room table, and upsetting the
    glasses and things. I suppose that's LANDSEER&mdash;no, I see
    it's some one of the name of SNYDERS. I expect he got the
    <i>idea</i> from LANDSEER, though, don't you?</p>

    <p><i>Her Comp.</i> Very likely indeed, dear; but (<i>pursuing
    her original train of thought</i>) you get rather nice tea at
    some of these aërated bread-shops; so perhaps if we
    waited&mdash;(<i>&amp;c., &amp;c.</i>)</p>

    <h4>IN GALLERY NO. III.</h4>

    <p><i>Two Pretty Nieces with an Elderly Uncle</i> (<i>coming to
    "Apollo and Marsyas," by Tintoretto</i>). What was the
    <i>story</i> of Apollo and Marsyas, Uncle?</p>

    <p><i>The Uncle</i>. Apollo? Oh, come, you've heard of
    <i>him</i>, the&mdash;er&mdash;Sun-God, Phoebus-Apollo, and all
    that?</p>

    <p><i>His Nieces</i>. Oh, yes, we know all <i>that</i>; but who
    was Marsyas, and what does the Catalogue mean by "Athena and
    three Umpires?"</p>

    <p><i>The Uncle</i>. Oh&mdash;er&mdash;hum! Didn't they teach
    you all that at school? Well they <i>ought</i> to have, that's
    all? Where's your Aunt&mdash;where's your Aunt?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Ernest Stodgely</i> (<i>before the Portrait of the
    Marchesa Isabella Grimaldi</i>). There, FLOSSIE, don't you feel
    the greatness of that now? I'm curious to know how it impresses
    you!</p>

    <p><i>Miss Featherhead</i>. Well, I rather like her frock,
    ERNEST. How funny to think aigrettes were worn so long ago,
    when they've just gone out <i>again</i>, don't you know. It
    must have been difficult to kiss a person across one of those
    enormous ruffs, though, don't you think?</p>

    <h4>IN GALLERY NO. IV.</h4>

    <p><i>Mr. Schohorff</i> (<i>loudly</i>). Ah, <i>that's</i> a
    picture I know well; seen it many a time in the Octagon Boudoir
    at dear old HATCHMENT's. But it looks better lighted up. I
    remember the last time I was down there they told me they'd
    been asked to lend it, but the Countess didn't seem to think
    (<i>&amp;c., &amp;c.</i>).</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. Frivell</i> (<i>before "Death of Dido," by Liberale
    da Verona</i>). Why is she standing on that pile of furniture
    in the courtyard, though?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> Because Æneas had jilted her, and so she
    stabbed herself on a funeral pyre after setting fire to it, you
    see.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> (<i>disapprovingly</i>). How <i>very</i> odd.
    I thought they only did that in India. But who are all those
    people looking-on?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> Smart people of the period, my dear. Of course
    Dido would send out invitations for a big function like
    that&mdash;Wind-up of the season&mdash;Farewell
    Reception&mdash;sure to be a tremendous rush for cards. Notice
    the evident enjoyment of the guests. They are depicted in the
    act of remarking to one another that their hostess is doing all
    in <i>her</i> power to make the thing go off well. Keen
    observer of human nature, old LIBERALE!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> Selfish creatures!</p>

    <h4>IN THE VESTIBULE.</h4>

    <p><i>Mrs. Townley-Ratton</i> (<i>about to leave with her
    husband, encounters her cousins, the</i> Miss RURAL-RATTONS,
    <i>who have just arrived</i>). Why, SOPHY, MARY! <i>how</i> are
    you? this is <i>too</i> delightful! When <i>did</i> you come
    up? How long are you going to be in town? <i>When</i> can you
    come and see me?</p>

    <p><i>Miss Sophy Rattan</i> (<i>answering the two last
    questions</i>). Till the end of the week. What will be the best
    time to find you?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. T.R.</i> (<i>warmly</i>). Oh, <i>any</i> time! I'm
    almost <i>always</i> in&mdash;except the afternoons, of course.
    I'm going out to tea or something every day this week!</p>

    <p><i>Miss Sophy R.</i> Well, how would some time in the
    morning&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. T.R.</i> The morning? No, I'm afraid&mdash;I'm
    <i>afraid</i> it <i>mustn't</i> be the morning <i>this</i>
    week&mdash;so many things that one <i>has</i> to see to!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.R.</i> (<i>lazily</i>). You'd better all come and
    dine quietly some evening.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He yawns, to tone down any excess of hospitality in
        this invitation.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mrs. T.R.</i> (<i>quickly</i>). No, that would be
    <i>too</i> cruel, when I know they'll want to go to a theatre
    every night! And besides, I really haven't a single free
    evening this week. But I must see if we can't <i>arrange</i>
    something. You really must drop me a line <i>next</i> time
    you're coming up! Good-bye, dears, we mustn't keep you from the
    pictures&mdash;such a fine collection this winter! Love to your
    Mother, and say I shall try to call&mdash;if I <i>possibly</i>
    can!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.R.</i> (<i>as they descend the stairs</i>). I say,
    SELINA, you forgot to ask 'em where they are. Shall I run back
    and find out, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. T.R.</i> Not on <i>any</i> account. They're probably
    at the Grand as usual, and if they're not, it will be a very
    good excuse if I can't call. You are such a <i>fusser</i>,
    ALFRED!</p>

    <p><i>Miss Sophy</i> (<i>to</i> Miss MARY). What a let-off! I
    wouldn't have minded lunch so much&mdash;but
    <i>dinner</i>&mdash;no, thank you, my dear!</p>

    <p><i>Miss Mary</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). She may call on Mother
    and ask us all yet.</p>

    <p><i>Miss Sophy</i>. She doesn't know where we are, and I took
    good care not to tell her. It's getting too dark to see much,
    but we'll just walk through the rooms, to say we've done
    it&mdash;shall we? [<i>They do.</i></p>
    <hr />

    <p>A SETTLER FOR MR. WOODS.&mdash;Mrs. RAM does not at all
    wonder at Amateurs being able to "pick up old pieces of china
    at CHRISTY's," for she has often heard that you've only got to
    go to King Street, where anyone may see them "knocked down
    under a hammer."</p>

    suddenly driven a couple of inches into my head, with loud

    <h2>THE SCALE WITH THE FALSE WEIGHTS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Page from the Newgate Calendar&mdash;up-to-date
    Edition</i>.)</h4>

    <p>The two Convicts were tried at the same Assizes, put in the
    same dock and sentenced by the same Judge. So a companionship
    sprang up between them considering that one was by birth and
    education a Gentlemen, and the other was not. And they went to
    the same prison, and listened to the same words of the same
    Chaplain, and took their occasional exercise in the same
    practising yard. And as luck would have it, they served the
    same time, and were liberated at the same moment.</p>

    <p>"I am afraid I must say good-bye, GILES," said ST. JAMES, as
    they emerged into freedom from the portals of the gaol. "Good
    fellow as you are, GILES, you do not belong to my set, and your
    presence would be embarrassing."</p>

    <p>"Oh, would it!" returned GILES, who had already recognised
    some of his friends. "Well, I don't want to press my company on
    anyone."</p>

    <p>"No offence!" exclaimed ST. JAMES, "I beg you&mdash;no
    offence! But we have both to begin life again, and union is not
    strength in a case such as ours!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, no offence!" acquiesced GILES, as he accompanied some
    of his pals to a neighbouring public-house.</p>

    <p>ST. JAMES, left to his own devices, hurried to the Chambers
    that he used to rent before he went to prison. They were "To
    Let." He rang the bell, and the porter started back when he saw
    him.</p>

    <p>"Hope you don't want to enter, Sir," said he; "but the
    Guv'nor gave strict orders, as if you called, that you was not
    to go in. It ain't my fault, Sir, but the Guv'nor is the
    Guv'nor!"</p>

    <p>Disheartened by this rebuff, he tried the house of a friend,
    but was so scornfully received, that he made up his mind never
    to visit another acquaintance. Of course he found that his name
    had been removed from his Clubs, and not a single individual
    would recognise him. He was an outcast, and a ruined man. So he
    walked about the streets until his shoes were in holes, and his
    last penny exhausted. Then he lay down to sleep. But this was
    against the regulations, and so he was hustled from pillar to
    post, until at last he found himself in a very low part of
    town. He was trudging past a public-house, when who should
    emerge from its cheerful-looking recesses but GILES. "Hallo!"
    cried the young man, who seemed the picture of health, "are
    <i>you</i> down?"</p>

    <p>"Yes&mdash;very," returned ST. JAMES. "I haven't a friend in
    the world, and no one will have anything to say to me."</p>

    <p>"What a shame!" cried the other. "Why, with me, I have had a
    rare old time! Everybody has been pleased to see me."</p>

    <p>"But hasn't your conviction injured you?"</p>

    <p>"Not particularly. I have lots of people who support me.
    Why, if we were <i>too</i> particular with one another, we
    shouldn't have a pal in the world! Hope there's nothing
    wrong."</p>

    <p>"Why, don't you call this wrong? Here are you, as jolly as
    possible, and I&mdash;a miserable man!"</p>

    <p>"Can't be helped. We are in the same box."</p>

    <p>"Are we?" said the semi-genteel Convict. "Well, I should
    have scarcely believed it! Then, I suppose I must comfort
    myself with the thought that the same law applies to the rich
    as the poor."</p>

    <p>"Does it?" returned the commoner Convict. "Then all I can
    say is, that whatever the law may be, the punishment is never
    the same." And ST. JAMES, with a bitter sigh, wished he could
    change places with his more fortunate dock-mate.</p>

    <h2>CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER.</h2>

    <h3>VI.&mdash;THE DUFFER AT WHIST.</h3>

    <p>Whist, it seems to me, is an affair of eyes, memory, and
    calculative ratiocination. As to eyes, I have a private theory
    that mine are bewitched. It is not mere short sight. At school
    and college I have seen Greek words on the printed page, and
    translated them correctly, and come to grief, because these
    words, on inspection, were somehow not there. Explain this I
    cannot, but it is a fact. The same with Whist; I see spades
    where clubs are, and diamonds for hearts, and a cold world
    accuses me of revoking and of carelessness, but it is
    <i>not</i> carelessness. It is something gone askew in
    phenomena. Thus, when I am a witness as to facts in a trial,
    perjury is the softest word for my testimony, so the Court
    thinks, because the Court is blessed with the usual relations
    between objective facts, and subjective impressions. I admit
    that I am less fortunate, but when I try to go into this, I am
    interrupted. However, this is why I revoke.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:55%;">
        <a href="images/125.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/125.png"
             alt="The Duffer at Whist." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Then as to memory, I have none, for cards. It is extremely
    difficult, indeed impossible, to recall who played what, after
    the cards are once out of sight. I could tell you, like the man
    in the story, that such and such a statement is on the ninety
    sixth page of the fifth volume of GIBBON, the page on the left,
    half-way down; useless things of that sort I remember: cards,
    not. As to calculation and inferences, I give it up. I just
    first play out all my kings, then all my aces, I lead trumps,
    if I have a bunch of them, and then it is my partner's turn to
    make his little points. I return his lead when I happen to
    think of it, which is not often. That is all <i>I</i> have to
    confess, but I have a friend, a brilliant player <i>I</i> call
    him, and he permits me to contribute his experiences, as mine
    are short and simple. To my mind, Whist would not be a bad
    game, if the element of skill were excluded; but give me
    Roulette. If foreign ladies would not snatch up my winnings, I
    should be a master at Roulette, where genius is really served,
    for I play on inspiration merely. But let me turn to the
    confessions of my friend, my Mentor, I may call him, a man who
    is a Member of the Burlington itself, one who has had losses,
    go to! Hear him speak:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I have always sympathised," he says, "with <i>Mr.
    Pickwick</i>, in regard to his experiences at Whist; that is to
    say, his experience on the second occasion narrated in his
    history. The first time, it will be remembered, all went well,
    when, owing to unfortunate lapses on the part of 'the criminal
    Miller,' who omitted to 'trump the diamond' and subsequently
    revoked, he and the fat gentleman were worsted in an encounter
    with <i>Mr. Wardle's</i> mother and the immortal hero.</p>

    <p>"But at Bath there was a different tale to tell, the
    <i>Dowager Lady Snuphanuph</i> and <i>Mrs. Colonel Wugsby</i>,
    proved too able for him and <i>Miss Bolo</i>, who when he
    played a wrong card, which, like me, he probably did every
    other time, looked a small armoury of daggers, and subsequently
    in a beautiful instance of the figure known to the grammarian
    as Hendiadys, went home in tears and a Sedan chair."</p>

    <p>Bearing in mind the advice attributed to TALLEYRAND, I have
    conscientiously endeavoured to become a Whist-player; but it is
    becoming increasingly obvious to me, that owing to the malison
    pronounced at my birth, my room is generally preferred to my
    company. And yet I have studied the subject according to my
    lights. Every instance of Whist in fiction which comes under my
    notice receives my undivided attention, and when I read Miss
    BROUGHTON, such a sentence as, "I suppose," she said, "that
    it's the right thing to play out all one's aces first? Her
    partner conscientiously endeavoured to veil the expression of
    extreme dissent which this proposition called forth, and with
    such success that the ace of hearts instantly and confidently
    followed his brother."</p>

    <p>When I read hints like these, I garner them up for my own
    future use. I have pored over every known text-book on the
    subject, from MATTHEWS and HOYLE to CAVENDISH. I once went so
    far as to learn the proper leads by rote, forgetting them all
    within a week; and owing to my inveterate habit of endeavouring
    to justify the most flagitious acts by a supposed reference to
    authority, have earned for myself the name of "Pole."</p>

    <p>There are some with whom I play, who contrive to make me
    feel more at my ease than do others, and even look upon me in
    virtue of my playing with "those men at the Club" as one having
    authority; for among the blind the one-eyed man is king. There
    is my Mother-in-law for instance, now I really enjoy a rubber
    with <i>her</i>. We sit down after dinner at a table scant of
    cloth, and either much too small or so inconveniently large
    that I cannot see the trump at the other end of it. She usually
    begins operations by misdealing, which is precisely what always
    happens to me with a new pack; nor do I yet understand how it
    is that the expert manages to deal at about sixty miles an hour
    without a mistake, whereas when my turn comes every other card
    seems to get stuck to its neighbour by a very superior kind of
    glue, so that they all come out in batches of twos and threes
    as it were, instead of one by one.</p>

    <p>But when the deal has come right, her next step is to sort
    her cards, which she does by placing all her trumps apart from
    the others between her third and fourth fingers; I can thus
    tell how many she has, and am further assisted by her generally
    dropping one or two in the process face upwards on the table.
    This would be punishable at the Club; but as she would consider
    it "mean" were any allusions made to it, nothing happens.
    Towards the end of the hand her attention is apt to wander, and
    owing to her abstraction play comes to a dead halt. When a hint
    is offered that we are waiting for her, with prompt and
    business-like alacrity but regardless of the rigorous formula,
    "Place your cards, please," she will say, "Who led a spade?"
    there being at the time a club, a heart, and a diamond on the
    table. Then, being the only one who has a card of the leader's
    suit left, she revokes but is not found out. When she leads out
    of turn, as happens on an average four or five times every
    rubber, if I am against her, I call a suit from her partner,
    upon which she says, flaring up, "Is <i>that</i> the way you
    play at the Club? 'Cheats never thrive.'" Nor do we, for the
    simple reason, that she seldom holds less than three honours in
    each suit, and from five to six trumps besides!</p>

    <p>This, as I said, is the sort of Whist I rather enjoy; but
    when it comes to playing in sober earnest at the Club, there is
    a different tale to tell.</p>

    <p>"AIRY FAIRY LILLY UN!"&mdash;One day last week, MR. W.S.
    LILLY&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> W. "SHIBBOLETHS" LILLY&mdash;delivered
    an excellent lecture on the Papal-Italian question, and
    although at Birmingham, it was by no means a brummagem
    discourse. But to quote the immortal ballad of <i>Billy
    Taylor</i>, "When the Captain he come for to hear on't, He
    werry much applauded what she'd done," and, to apply the lines
    to the present instance, "When the POPE he comes for to hear
    on't," <i>will</i> he "werry much applaud," the opinions
    honestly and courteously enough expressed in this lecture? By
    the way, "LEO and the Lilly" would make a fine subject for a
    historical cartoon. The learned Lecturer took care to observe,
    with all the true modesty of the humble flower from which his
    name is derived, that he spoke only the opinion of a party,
    which party, whether small, considerable, or large, his
    audience could judge for themselves with the unclothed optic,
    as the party in question was, not to put too fine a point on
    it, Himself.</p>

    <h2>WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY IT?</h2>

    <p>In an interesting description (that appeared in the
    <i>Times</i> for Saturday, February 27) of the working of the
    "Jacquard Card-Preparing Machine," which is, it appears, "a
    machine for superseding the human brain, eye, and
    hand"&mdash;(so that soon all who can afford it will be fitted
    up with these machines, and keep their brains, eyes, and hands
    in reserve for very special occasions)&mdash;it was stated that
    "the blank cards are automatically fed to the punches." That
    punches should be spelt without the capital P is of course a
    Printer's error, deserving capital punishment. <i>Mr. P.</i>
    thinks it right to state in answer to numerous inquiries, that
    all his <i>Punches</i> speak by the card. But as to even the
    smallest of the <i>Punch</i> family being "fed" on cards, or
    getting his or her living by cards, the statement is utterly at
    variance with the facts. <i>Mr. P.</i> is quite sure that the
    "Jacquard Automatic Reading and Punching Syndicate" will at
    once retract the injurious statement, or the youthful, vigorous
    and pugnacious <i>Punches</i> will be inquiring of <i>Mr.
    P.</i>, as <i>Sam Weller</i> did of <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> when
    that gentleman's great name was apparently taken in vain,
    "Ain't nobody to be whopped for takin' this here liberty?" that
    is, adapting the question to the present occasion, "Ain't
    nobody's head to be Punch'd for this mis-use of an ancient and
    honourable name?"</p>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February 29.</i>&mdash;Mr. G.
    looked in to-night from the Riviera; greeted with rousing cheer
    from Opposition; didn't expect to see him to-day; just arrived
    from Mediterranean <i>viâ</i> Paris; most men in such
    circumstances would have gone straight home, read their
    letters, had quiet dinner, "and so to bed," as the late Mr.
    PEPYS occasionally remarked.</p>

    <p>"That's all very well for you elderly fellows, TOBY," said
    Mr. G., beaming with health and smiles. "ARMITSTEAD, for
    example, went straight off home. I was careful to see about
    that; he's a fine fellow, and I humoured him by letting him
    suppose he was looking after me as far as Biarritz, and on to
    Pau. In no other way could I have got him to make a holiday.
    Think I rather wore him out at St. Raphael. When a man gets
    over sixty he doesn't care about his ten or fifteen mile walk
    before luncheon. However, I brought ARMITSTEAD back all right,
    and, packing him off home at Charing Cross, just popped in here
    to see how you are getting on."</p>

    <p>In respect of business, not getting on at all. Things going
    awry. Ministerialists won't come up to scratch in Division
    Lobby; Majority that used to flash forth a hundred-candlelight
    strong, now flickered down to a score. Opposition growing
    jubilant and aggressive; Irish Members, long quiescent, waking
    up as of yore. To-night Prince ARTHUR, stung to quick by
    remarks from JOHN DILLON, made rattling speech defending his
    Irish policy; poured contumely and scorn on heads of Irish
    Members.</p>

    <p>"You," he said, with gesture of passionate scorn, "see no
    source of regeneration for Ireland but in refusal of tenants to
    pay their rent."</p>

    <p>Lord ELCHO and other young bloods on Ministerial Bench
    cheered; old stagers looked
    grave.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
       id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>

    <p>"Ah, ah!" said CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN, looking on from the Front
    Opposition Bench, "I spy the beard of the Irish Secretary under
    the muffler of the Leader of the House."</p>

    <p>"Dear me," said ESSLEMONT, who overheard the remark; "I
    don't remember BALFOUR with a beard when he was at the Irish
    Office. You're not mixing him up with GRANDOLPH?"</p>

    <p>"Get thee to a nunnery, worthy draper," said
    CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN, "and in that leisurely retirement read your
    SHAKSPEARE."</p>

    <p>"A nunnery!" cried ESSLEMONT, more than ever bewildered;
    "why they wouldn't let me in. I suppose you mean a monastery;
    but man and boy for fifty years I've gone to Kirk, and nothing
    would&mdash;" By this time CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN was out of
    hearing.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;One Vote in Committee of
    Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;The MARKISS not in his place in Lords
    to-night. Looked in at Arlington Street to inquire if absence
    was due to illness.</p>

    <p>"Not at all, TOBY," said the MARKISS who, indeed, looked
    quite fit. "There was nothing particular on the paper to-night,
    so I didn't go down. It's necessary for Nephew ARTHUR to be
    regular in his attendance on the Commons. But in the Lords it's
    different. A happy fortune places the Leader there in a
    position that relieves him from strain of unbroken attendance.
    With STRATHEDEN AND CAMPBELL looking after foreign policy, and
    DENMAN taking charge of home affairs, my post is really a
    sinecure. They talk about ending or mending of the House of
    Lords; but as long as we are blessed with this remarkable
    combination of legislative and administrative capacity we can
    laugh at the idle threats."</p>

    <p>It was DENMAN who took the floor to-night; moved Second
    Reading of a Bill, the simple and comprehensive object of which
    was to repeal Local Government Acts of England and Scotland.
    These passed only a Session or two ago by continuous united
    effort of both Houses of Parliament. DENMAN been closely
    watching them in operation. Finds them disappointing, and so
    would have them repealed. House fully constituted, with LORD
    CHANCELLOR on Woolsack, Mace on Table, and quorum present;
    gravely listens, whilst tall, white-haired, sad-faced man
    rambles on in plaintive voice, urging proposition which, if
    carried out, would arrest machinery of Local Government
    throughout the Kingdom, leaving all to be gone over again. No
    one smiles, much less winks or wags the head. It is just as
    solemn and as orderly as if it were the MARKISS himself
    submitting a Resolution or making a statement. Only, when the
    plaintive voice ceases and the tall figure is reseated on the
    Bench, nobody proposes to continue the conversation. LORD
    CHANCELLOR rapidly gabbles shibboleth in which "content"
    stumbles over "not content."</p>

    <p>"Notcontentshaveit," says LORD CHANCELLOR, by way of last
    word; leaves Woolsack; the few Peers slowly pass out. It seems
    the House has adjourned, DENMAN's Motion being negatived
    without Division, and Local Government in England and Scotland
    will proceed to-morrow as it has gone on to-day.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;House of Commons, having agreed
    to meet at two o'clock to-morrow instead of twelve, makes up
    for it by getting itself Counted Out at eight o'clock.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Came across LOCKWOOD this afternoon
    in remote part of corridor, gesticulating whilst he recited
    some lines. Fancy he's getting up that lecture on the "Lawyers
    in <i>Pickwick</i>," announced for delivery in York on the
    15th. Most interesting undertaking. As CHARLES RUSSELL says,
    "<i>Coke-upon-Lyttleton</i> will have to take a back shelf in
    the Law libraries when <i>Lockwood-upon-Dickens</i> is in
    circulation."</p>

    <p>Wonder how he finds time for these excursions into the
    bye-paths of literature? Hands full at the Bar; frequent
    attendant here; and yet he has time to discover
    <i>Pickwick</i>! He tells me great secret of capability for
    this kind of work is plain living and regular habits.</p>

    <p>"A chop or steak at eight o'clock with a potato (boiled in
    its jacket) and a tumbler of toast-and-water; that's my regular
    dinner; leaves me clear-headed and free for a couple of hours'
    work at my briefs before I go to bed. Except when kept down at
    House, rarely out of bed after eleven. Up at five; cold bath;
    dry toast; hot milk; another grind at my briefs; ride down to
    Court; at it all day, with intervals for Abernethy biscuit when
    Court adjourns; and so the mill goes round."</p>

    <p>"Don't you think," said BOB REID, "it's a little
    unprofessional of LOCKWOOD going into this <i>Pickwick</i>
    business? The cases were never, that I know of, reported in the
    <i>Law Journal</i>. Good fellow LOCKWOOD, but a little apt to
    stray outside the ropes. Now he's started lecturing, there's no
    knowing how far he'll go. We may see him on the stage bowling
    BEERBOHM TREE out as <i>Hamlet</i>, or even with his face
    corked, dancing a breakdown at St. James's Hall. What does he
    want to go a-lecturing for? Do you think he'll draw?"</p>

    <p>"Draw!" I cried. "Why, he's always drawing; he's drawn for
    <i>Punch</i>." That shut up Master BOB. When you want to hear
    disparaging remarks about a man, nothing like going to his
    bosom friend. <i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Irish.</p>

             Suavity."
    </div>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Mr. G. in fine form to-night;
    delivered two speeches, each in highest form of Parliamentary
    Debate. Infinite variety in manner. Before dinner, Prince
    ARTHUR moved to take Morning Sittings on Tuesdays and Fridays
    for rest of Session. That means virtual appropriation on very
    threshold of Session of time belonging to private Members. They
    furious; Mr. G. in benignest mood; shocked, he must confess, at
    Prince ARTHUR's unparalleled greed; but not disposed to turn a
    deaf ear to his importunity. "If you'd make it Easter, now," he
    said, with winning voice and manner, "limit the scope of
    resolution to that date, I'm not sure that I should feel
    disposed to say you nay."</p>

    <p>Prince ARTHUR jumped at proposal. Sufficient unto Easter are
    the Morning Sittings thereof. If he wanted more he could ask
    again. Meanwhile he was in possession of what he wanted.</p>

    <p>House looked on in amazement at this little scene.
    Opposition expected Mr. G. would have thundered forth
    denunciations of Prince ARTHUR's audacity. Here he was making
    terms with the enemy; doing it all, too, with imposingly
    judicial manner that was irresistible. Before House quite knew
    where it was, everything was settled.</p>

    <p>"'Now I'm furnished, Now I'm furnished, for my
    flight'&mdash;of oratory."</p>

    <p>It was BLUNDELL MAPLE chanting this line, sung in another
    place by <i>Hecate</i>. Flight didn't amount to more than
    asking question as to whether audiences at unlicensed places of
    entertainment (in neighbourhood of Tottenham Court Road or
    elsewhere) open for Radical or Liberal entertainments, are duly
    protected from fire? Members went off to dinner, pondering on
    this conundrum. Came back to find Mr. G. on his legs again,
    denouncing proposition to vote £20,000 for survey of railway
    from Mombasa to Nyanza. A splendid piece of invective; almost
    literally shrivelled up poor JOKIM, at whom some of the
    scorching flame was pointed with outstretched forefinger. For
    more than half an hour, at period of night when most gentlemen
    of his years are snugly tucked up in bed, Mr. G. held the
    audience entranced, thunderous cheers rolling forth in rapid
    succession from Liberal ranks, now and then answered by low
    growl from Ministerialists.</p>

    <p>"What a man it is!" cried KENRICK, looking on with
    monumental suavity; "almost sorry he left us. Sometimes, at his
    best, he equals our JOE." <i>Business done</i>.&mdash;A couple
    of Votes in Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;BRYCE at last got access to mountains
    in Scotland.</p>

    <p>Been wandering round foot of them through many Sessions, and
    several Parliaments. Always something happened to prevent his
    reaching the top. Don't believe he'd have got there to-night,
    only for FARQUHARSON.</p>

    <p>When F. came forward to second Motion, incidentally
    observing, "I'm the proprietor of a mountain myself," we felt
    something must be done, and BRYCE's Motion was agreed to.</p>

    <p>FARQUHARSON, for rest of evening, object of respectful
    regard. Some inquiry as to where he kept his mountain. Did he
    bring it to Town with him when he came up for the Session? And,
    when at home, was he in habit of leaving it out all night?</p>

    <p>"Don't happen to have it about you, I suppose?" WILFRID
    LAWSON asked, eyeing his trousers' pockets.</p>

    <p>FARQUHARSON very reticent on subject. Rumour, just before
    House adjourned, that his mountain is one of those situated in
    the Moon&mdash;but this only envy.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
